//
// Some hosts (observed: KakaoTalk) deliver the SAME physical keyDown to the IME twice,
// which makes each backspace decompose two jamo and each character double up. We drop a
// keyDown that is an exact re-delivery of the immediately-preceding one. Distinguishing a
// re-delivery from legitimate input is safe because:
//   • auto-repeat events carry isARepeat=true (a real key HOLD) — never deduped here;
//   • a human cannot tap the same key twice within 50ms;
// so only a non-repeat same-keyCode event arriving <50ms after another non-repeat
// same-keyCode event is a machine duplicate. Pure + testable.

// into the document as REAL text and rewritten in place on each keystroke. The
